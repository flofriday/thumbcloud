# Thumbcloud
Thumbcloud is a file-sharing server to replace your USB thumbdrive
![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Unmaintained
I don't intend to maintain this project. It's been a couple of years and I no longer work with rust on a regular basis.

## Idea and State
Sharing files via a USB thumbdrive is not optimal:
* only one user can access the content at a time
* you have to carry a physical object (which you will for sure forget when you need it the most, thanks to [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law))
* USB connections are "slow"
* not all modern computers have USB type A ports
* USB drives are limited in size (often just a few GB)

Thumbcloud is my attempt to create an application to share files with friends and collegues, on the 
same network. Moreover, they don't need to install any additional software (all they need is a 
webbrowser).

__Disclaimer__: The software is still in early development and misses some features. Furthermore,
there are few bugs and maybe even security flaws. In a nutshell, you shouldn't use the software on
an untrusted network nor with sensitive data, but feel free to try it out.

## Install
Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/flofriday/thumbcloud/releases) and unpack it.

Warning: Windows and macOS might warn you because the binaries are not singed.
Feel to free ignore those warnings.

### Build from source
1. [Install rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html)
2. [Download the repository](https://github.com/flofriday/thumbcloud/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip the compressed file and run `cargo build --release`
4. Run the executable<br> 
   Windows PowerShell: `.\target\release\thumbcloud.exe $HOME --open`<br>
   Windows CMD: `.\target\release\thumbcloud.exe %HOMEPATH% --open`<br>
   Unix (macOS, Linux, FreeBSD): `./target/release/thumbcloud $HOME --open`

## Usage
1. Open a terminal in the directory with the executable
2. Windows CMD: `.\thumbcloud.exe %HOMEPATH% --open`<br>
   Windows PowerShell: `.\thumbcloud.exe $HOME --open`<br>
   Unix (macOS, Linux FreeBSD): `./thumbcloud $HOME --open`

```
